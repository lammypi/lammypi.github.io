The spaces in which we live, work, and play incorporate various technologies for enhancing interactions within our environments. As UX professionals, we excel at studying technology use and designing to support users, but we may only allocate a comparatively small amount of effort studying environments. However, with more spaces being designed to incorporate smart and/or immersive technologies, opportunities abound for UX professionals to collaborate with architects to understand the design and use of space.

This might sound both daunting and exciting, but the evidence-based design process of architects complements the innate curiosity and drive of UX professionals to understand and improve the world around us. This talk will highlight the synergies between UX and architecture, exploring how the disciplines can successfully work together to infuse technology into physical spaces.
