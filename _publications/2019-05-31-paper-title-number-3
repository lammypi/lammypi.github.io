excerpt: 'Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) continues its determined march toward becoming a part of our personal lives and workdays. Sometimes its presence is negligible — it is not there until you access it, like Siri, or it runs unobtrusively, like Spotify. Other times, A.I. is a boogeyman posing a threat to our livelihoods, the intangible enemy waiting to replace us at our jobs. Does it have to be that way, though? '
