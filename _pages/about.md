Hi, I'm Liv! I'm a mixed methods UX Researcher interested in Data Science, AI, and machine learning. There is a lot of data out there that UXers can use, and data science and NLP offer two powerful ways of exploring and making sense of that data. This site is my way of bringing my thought process to others, and hopefully opening up a dialog.

I've just started moving information over to this site, so it's a bit sparse at the moment. However, if you're interested in seeing my portfolio, please reach out to me via LinkedIn.
