Hi, I'm Liv! I'm a mixed methods UX Researcher interested in Data Science, AI, and machine learning. There is a lot of data out there that UXers can use, and data science methods offer powerful ways of exploring and making sense of it all. This site is my way of bringing my thought process to others, and hopefully opening up a dialog.

I'm still working on this site, but you can see some of my recent research and strategy drafts in my [portfolio](https://lesliemcfarlin.com/portfolio). Due to the nature of products I work on, I only share my design portfolio when requested via my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/lesliemcfarlin). 

If you're interested in my (quite sparse) technical samples, check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/lammypi). You can also see some of my previous and in-progress visualization work on my [Tableau profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/liv.mcfarlin).
